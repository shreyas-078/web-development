This is my first project that implements usage of external Node modules.

It utilizes the dayJS module to fetch your current timezone and display the current time and date in your timezone.

It also allows you to select from one of 5 timezones and display the time and date of that particular timezone.

How to run this project on your local machine:

  1. Place all the repo files into a folder.
  2. Open terminal in the folder and run ```npm init```
  3. Install the necessary modules: (Run the command:  ```npm install dayjs```)
  4. Make sure all the files from the repo and the ```node_modules``` folder are in the same directory.
  5. Use Live server to open the ```index.html``` file.
